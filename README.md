# MovieSearch
A sample app that allows a simple search for a movie.

It's a very basic app (with a VERY basic design) using UIKit and Codables
The goal is only to demonstrate the use of a MVVM-C pattern going along with a generic networking logic.
TMDB is really convenient for sample apps as it uses a simple REST api similar to the ones we can find on other services. And there's no quey limitation!
As iOS developers we often find ourselves displaying a JSON, well this is a little sample that demonstrate how it's done... and without any external library ;) 

IMPORTANT: You have to use your own TMDB api key. Create it at [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/). Once you have one set it in MovieSearch/Configuration/ApiKeys.swift
